## Authentication

[Docs](https://apidocs.hunter2.com/#authentication)

* Don't the `missing`+`rotated` responses expose the API to credential stuffing? The performance of this would be [like Bogosort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort) so the risk is probably very low.
  * This assumes that I have a proper key.
  * If I have to have both a proper key and an old secret, then the risk is even lower.
  * I need valid API creds to play with this.

## Users

[Docs](https://apidocs.hunter2.com/#users-2)

* The [Get Users Details docs](https://apidocs.hunter2.com/#get-users-details) show `{current,next,previous}Url` as `/api/onboarding`; is this wrong?
* [Get User Progress](https://apidocs.hunter2.com/#get-user-progress) mentions a `page` query param. There are no examples. It also says "page of users to get" but the response format has pages of lessons.
