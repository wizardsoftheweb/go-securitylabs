## Overview

My goal for this package is to provide a simple Go client for the Veracode Security Labs API.

## References

## Notes

I don't have access to a Veracode Security Labs account for testing. My current employer wanted me to write a proposal to be able to develop against our account off-hours. That's work and I don't like doing work for hobby code. If you're interested in sponsoring me or providing access to an account I can run tests against, feel free to reach out!

Sometime soon I'll have all the GitHub niceties like a Contributing.md and issues templates.

## Tentative Roadmap

None of these are in any particular order.

### Library

- [ ] Get something simple pulled out of the wrapper article
- [ ] Learn how to use `httptest.Server`
- [ ] Mock all the available URLs
- [ ] Develop wrappers for each endpoint (expand this list?)

### Housekeeping

- [ ] Set up CI pipelines (GHA? CircleCI?)
- [ ] Define nice status checks like code coverage

#### `golangci-lint`

- [ ] Reenable `unused`
- [ ] Follow `structcheck` issue fix for Go 1.18
