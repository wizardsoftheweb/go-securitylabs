## Overview

My goal for this package is to provide a simple Go client for the Veracode Security Labs API.

## Usage

### Authentication

Ideally you're not hardcoding creds in your code and you're instead using environment variables. In your shell,

```bash
export VSL_AUTH_KEY="<your-api-key>"
export VSL_AUTH_SECRET="<your-api-secret>"
```

In your code,

```go
client := securitylabs.NewClient(nil, nil)
_ = client.SetAuthFromEnvironment()
```

If you don't want to use the environment variables I've exposed or you want to pull them in some other way, you can do this instead:

```go
client := securitylabs.NewClient(nil, nil)
client.SetAuth("<your-api-key>", "<your-api-secret>")
```

### Users

[Docs](https://apidocs.hunter2.com/#users-2)

```go
client.GetUsers(context.Background(), nil)
// Returns a list of users from the first page
```

```go
page := new(int)
*page = 47
client.GetUser(context.Background(), &GetUsersOptions{Page: page})
// Returns a list of users from the nth page
```

## Notes

I don't have access to a Veracode Security Labs account for testing. My current employer wanted me to write a proposal to be able to develop against our account off-hours. That's work and I don't like doing work for hobby code. If you're interested in sponsoring me or providing access to an account I can run tests against, feel free to reach out!

Sometime soon I'll have all the GitHub niceties like a Contributing.md and issues templates.

## Tentative Roadmap
