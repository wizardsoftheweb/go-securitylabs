## Overview

My goal for this package is to provide a simple Go client for the Veracode Security Labs API.

```go
import "github.com/wizardsoftheweb/go-securitylabs/vsl"
```

Check out [the examples](./example) for usage.

## Notes

I don't have access to a Veracode Security Labs account for testing. My current employer wanted me to write a proposal to be able to develop against our account off-hours. That's work and I don't like doing work for hobby code. If you're interested in sponsoring me or providing access to an account I can run tests against, feel free to reach out!

Sometime soon I'll have all the GitHub niceties like a Contributing.md and issues templates.

I have [several open questions](docs/open_questions.md).
